Trading Platform Implementation Documentation
Current Implementation Status
Backend Architecture
The platform currently operates with a FastAPI-based backend that provides comprehensive strategy management capabilities. The system uses MongoDB with Motor for asynchronous data storage, supporting collections for strategies, backtest results, signals, and trades. The Strategy Factory pattern enables dynamic strategy instantiation, while the Data Feed system integrates with Alpaca API for both historical and live market data. The Execution Engine handles trade simulation, and the Backtest Engine runs historical strategy testing with realistic P&L calculations.
Frontend Architecture
The React-based frontend provides a modern, responsive interface with React Router for navigation and Chart.js for data visualization. The application includes dedicated pages for strategy listing, creation, editing, and testing. The Strategy Editor Page allows users to modify strategy configurations via both form inputs and YAML editing, with integrated backtest functionality that displays results in a flexbox layout below the edit form. The API Service layer handles all backend communication with proper error handling and data formatting.
